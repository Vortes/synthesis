# Synthesis — Architecture & Technical Decisions

> Reference document for the Synthesis monorepo. Covers architecture, tech stack, data flow, deployment, and key decisions made during planning.

---

## Tech Stack Summary

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo | Fast, proven monorepo tooling. pnpm over bun because of Electron native module compatibility. |
| Web App | Next.js (T3-style) | Serves the web UI, API (tRPC), and landing page. Familiar from T3 stack. |
| Desktop App | Electron Forge + Vite | Official Electron toolchain with Vite for fast dev/HMR. |
| Shared UI | React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui | shadcn works in both Next.js and Electron (renderer is just a browser window). |
| API Layer | tRPC | Type-safe API shared between web and desktop. Defined once, consumed by both apps. |
| Database | Prisma + Neon (PostgreSQL) | Serverless Postgres. Prisma runs server-side only (in Next.js), never in Electron. |
| Image Storage | Uploadthing | Screenshots stored via Uploadthing. Metadata (tags, colors, etc.) stored in Neon. |
| AI Analysis | OpenAI GPT-4o | Vision model for auto-tagging captures (component type, colors, typography, tags). |
| Auth | Clerk | Managed auth for both web and Electron. |

## Monorepo Structure

├── package.json              # Root workspace config
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml       # Workspace definitions
├── turbo.json                # Turborepo pipeline config
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                  # Next.js — web app + API + landing page
│   └── desktop/              # Electron Forge + Vite — desktop app

│   └── db/                   # Prisma schema + client (Neon)
```

### Package Responsibilities

**`packages/ui`** — All shared React components live here. Uses shadcn/ui (React + Tailwind + Radix). Both `apps/web` and `apps/desktop` import from `@synthesis/ui`. This is the single source of truth for the design system.

**`packages/api`** — tRPC router definitions and Zod input schemas. Defines the shape of every API endpoint. Imported by `apps/web` to mount as a server, and by `apps/desktop` to get type-safe client calls.

**`packages/db`** — Prisma schema, client, and migrations. Only used server-side by `apps/web`. The Electron app never imports this package.

---

## Data Flow

### How Electron Talks to the Backend

```
Electron App  ──HTTP──▶  Next.js (apps/web)  ──Prisma──▶  Neon Postgres
(user's Mac)              /api/trpc route                   (cloud DB)
```

- The Electron app NEVER connects to the database directly.
- Database credentials live only on the server (Next.js environment variables).
- The Electron renderer calls tRPC endpoints over HTTP to the deployed web app.

### How the Web App Calls the API

```
apps/web server components  → call tRPC directly (no network hop, runs in-process)
apps/web client components  → call tRPC via React Query + Next.js API route
apps/desktop renderer       → call tRPC over HTTP to apps/web/api/trpc
```

### Screenshot Capture Flow

```
User captures screenshot (global hotkey → Electron overlay → select region)
  → Electron main process takes the capture
  → Uploads image via Uploadthing (through tRPC endpoint)
  → Saves metadata to Neon (tRPC mutation → Prisma)
  → AI analysis triggered (OpenAI GPT-4o Vision) → tags written back to Neon
```

---

## tRPC Setup

tRPC routers are defined in `packages/api` and consumed differently by each app:

| Consumer | How it consumes tRPC | Network hop? |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/web` — server components | Direct caller (`api.capture.search()`) | None — runs in-process |
| `apps/web` — client components | React Query via Next.js API route | Internal (stays on server infra) |
| `apps/desktop` — renderer | HTTP client pointed at `apps/web/api/trpc` | Yes — over the network |

One router definition, two consumers, full type safety end to end.

---

## Prisma & Neon

- Prisma schema lives in `packages/db`.
- Prisma client is generated and exported from `packages/db`.
- Only `apps/web` imports from `packages/db`. The desktop app never uses Prisma.
- Neon connection string is set as `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/web/.env` only.
- Prisma connects to Neon via standard PostgreSQL adapter with `?sslmode=require`.

---

## Electron Architecture

### Electron vs Electron Builder vs Electron Forge

| | What it is | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Electron** | The framework/runtime (Chromium + Node.js) | Provides `BrowserWindow`, `ipcMain`, `globalShortcut`, etc. |
| **Electron Builder** | Standalone packaging tool | Alternative to Forge — config-heavy, very flexible |
| **Electron Forge** | Official all-in-one toolchain (dev + build + package + distribute) | What we use. Handles the full lifecycle. |

**We use Electron Forge with the Vite plugin.**

### Electron App Structure

```
apps/desktop/
├── forge.config.ts              # Forge config (makers, publishers, plugins)
├── vite.main.config.ts          # Vite config for main process
├── vite.renderer.config.ts      # Vite config for renderer (React app)
├── vite.preload.config.ts       # Vite config for preload script
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts                  # Main process — Node.js: shortcuts, IPC, window mgmt
│   ├── preload.ts               # Bridge: exposes safe APIs from main to renderer via contextBridge
│   └── renderer/                # React app — imports from @synthesis/ui
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── App.tsx
│       └── ...
```

### Key Electron Concepts

- **Main process** — Node.js. Has full OS access. Handles global shortcuts, screen capture, file system, IPC.
- **Renderer process** — Chromium browser window. Runs the React app. No direct Node.js access for security.
- **Preload script** — Runs before the renderer loads. Uses `contextBridge` to safely expose specific main-process APIs to the renderer.
- **IPC** — Communication between main and renderer. Analogous to tRPC between client and server.

### Electron Features Used (from Product.md)

- `globalShortcut` — capture hotkey
- `desktopCapturer` — screen/window capture
- `BrowserWindow` with transparency — capture overlay
- macOS Accessibility APIs — smart element detection (Phase 2)

---

## Shared UI — shadcn/ui

shadcn/ui works in both Next.js and Electron because:
- It's just React components + Tailwind CSS + Radix primitives
- Electron's renderer is a Chromium browser window — all web components work identically
- Components are set up once in `packages/ui` and imported by both apps as `@synthesis/ui`

---

## Web App Route Structure

The Next.js app serves three concerns from one deployment:

```
apps/web/src/app/
├── (marketing)/                # Landing page — public, no auth
│   ├── page.tsx                # Hero, features, download CTA
│   ├── pricing/page.tsx        # Pricing page
│   └── layout.tsx              # Marketing layout (no app chrome)
├── (app)/                      # Web app — authenticated
│   ├── library/page.tsx        # Capture library
│   ├── collections/page.tsx    # Collections
│   └── layout.tsx              # App layout (sidebar, nav)
└── api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts    # tRPC API endpoint (consumed by both web client and Electron)
```

Next.js route groups `(marketing)` and `(app)` provide different layouts on the same domain. No need for a separate landing page app.

---

## Deployment

### Web App + API + Landing Page → Vercel

- Deploy `apps/web` to Vercel.
- Vercel natively resolves monorepo dependencies from `packages/*`.
- Vercel project settings: Root directory = `apps/web`, Framework = Next.js.
- Serves: `synthesis.app` (landing), `synthesis.app/library` (web app), `synthesis.app/api/trpc` (API).

### Electron App → GitHub Releases

The Electron app builds into platform-specific installers and uploads to GitHub Releases.

**Build pipeline (GitHub Actions CI):**

```
Push to main (or tag a release)
  → CI runs: electron-forge make
  → Produces: Synthesis-x.x.x-arm64.dmg (Apple Silicon)
  → Produces: Synthesis-x.x.x-x64.dmg (Intel Mac)
  → Uploads to GitHub Releases
  → Landing page "Download" button points to latest release
```

**Forge publisher config:**

```ts
// apps/desktop/forge.config.ts
publishers: [
  {
    name: '@electron-forge/publisher-github',
    config: {
      repository: { owner: 'yourname', name: 'synthesis' },
      prerelease: false,
    },
  },
]
```

**Auto-updates:** Electron's built-in `autoUpdater` checks GitHub Releases on app launch and updates in the background.

**Code signing:** Required for public macOS distribution. Apple Developer account ($99/yr). Electron Forge handles signing config — you provide the certificates. Not needed during development.

### Deployment Summary

```
synthesis.app (Vercel)
├── /                    → Landing page with "Download for Mac" button → GitHub Release .dmg
├── /library             → Web app (authenticated, same UI as desktop)
├── /api/trpc/*          → API consumed by both web app and Electron

GitHub Releases
└── Synthesis-x.x.x.dmg → Downloaded and installed by users
    └── App calls synthesis.app/api/trpc for all data
    └── Auto-updates check GitHub Releases on launch
```

## Key Decisions Log

| Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Package manager | pnpm | Bun has compatibility issues with Electron native modules. pnpm is fast and proven. |
| Monorepo tool | Turborepo | Works natively with pnpm workspaces. Simple config. |
| Electron toolchain | Electron Forge + Vite | Official, handles full lifecycle (dev → distribute), Vite gives fast HMR. |
| UI framework | shadcn/ui (React + Tailwind + Radix) | Works identically in browser and Electron. One component library for both apps. |
| API layer | tRPC | Type-safe, defined once in `packages/api`, consumed by both apps. Familiar from T3. |
| Database | Prisma + Neon (Postgres) | Server-side only. Neon is serverless Postgres. Prisma for type-safe queries. |
| DB in Electron | None — calls API over HTTP | Can't embed DB credentials in a desktop app. All data access goes through the API. |
| Landing page | Routes in `apps/web` | No separate app. Next.js route groups separate marketing layout from app layout. |
| Desktop distribution | GitHub Releases via Electron Forge publisher | Simple, supports auto-updates, free. |
| Platform | Mac-first | Per Product.md. Windows in Phase 3. |
| AI analysis | OpenAI GPT-4o | Strong vision capabilities for screenshot analysis (component detection, colors, tags). |
| Image storage | Uploadthing | Built for Next.js/T3. Simple API, handles presigned URLs. Good for MVP. |
| Auth | Clerk | Managed auth, fast setup, good free tier. Works in both web and Electron. |
| Capture method | Global (Electron overlay) | Full screen capture via Electron overlay window. Requires screen capture permissions. |
| Data model | Lean — 2 tables (User, Capture) | Tags as JSON field. No collections/flows for MVP. Expand when patterns emerge. |

## Build Phases

Each phase produces a testable, verifiable result. Complete them in order.

### Phase 1 — Monorepo Skeleton

Scaffold root config, all packages, and both apps with placeholder content.

**Verify:** `pnpm dev:web` opens Next.js on localhost. `pnpm dev:desktop` opens an Electron window. Both show a "Hello Synthesis" page using a shared component from `@synthesis/ui`.

### Phase 2 — shadcn/ui + Shared Components

Set up Tailwind + shadcn in `packages/ui`. Build a basic app shell layout (sidebar, topbar) used by both apps.

**Verify:** Both web and desktop render the same app shell with shadcn components (buttons, card, etc.). Changing a component in `packages/ui` updates both apps.

### Phase 3 — Auth (Clerk)

Add Clerk to the web app and Electron app. Implement sign-up, sign-in, and protected routes.

**Verify:** Can sign up on web, see the authenticated app shell. Can sign in from Electron, same flow. Unauthenticated users get redirected to login.

### Phase 4 — Database + tRPC

Set up Prisma schema (User, Capture), connect to Neon, wire up tRPC routers in `packages/api`, mount in the web app, connect from Electron.

**Verify:** After signing in, call a test tRPC endpoint from both web and Electron that reads/writes to Neon. Confirm data shows up in Prisma Studio.

### Phase 5 — Image Upload + Library View

Integrate Uploadthing for image uploads. Build a basic library page that displays uploaded captures in a grid.

**Verify:** Upload an image (manual file picker for now) from the web app. It appears in the library grid with a timestamp. Same library visible from Electron. Delete a capture, it disappears.

### Phase 6 — AI Tagging

Send uploaded screenshots to OpenAI GPT-4o Vision. Parse the response into structured tags (component type, colors, description). Store in the `tags` JSON field. Display tags on captures in the library. Add basic search/filter by tags.

**Verify:** Upload a screenshot of any UI. Tags auto-populate within a few seconds. Search "button" or "navbar" and matching captures surface.

### Phase 7 — Global Capture (Electron Overlay)

Implement the global hotkey, transparent overlay window, region selection, and automatic save-to-library flow in Electron.

**Verify:** Open any app on your Mac. Press the capture hotkey. Overlay appears. Drag to select a region. Screenshot is captured, uploaded, AI-tagged, and appears in your library — all without leaving the app you were in.
